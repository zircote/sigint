# Porter's Five Forces Framework

## Overview

Michael Porter's Five Forces framework analyzes industry structure to determine competitive intensity and profitability potential.

## The Five Forces

### 1. Competitive Rivalry

**Definition**: Intensity of competition among existing firms.

**High Rivalry When**:
- Many competitors of similar size
- Slow industry growth
- High fixed costs
- Low differentiation
- High exit barriers

**Assessment Questions**:
- How many direct competitors exist?
- What is the industry growth rate?
- How differentiated are products?
- What are the exit barriers?

**Rating Scale**:
| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Few competitors, high differentiation |
| 3 | Moderate competition |
| 5 | Intense rivalry, commodity market |

### 2. Supplier Power

**Definition**: Ability of suppliers to drive up input costs.

**High Power When**:
- Few suppliers dominate
- Unique or differentiated inputs
- High switching costs
- Threat of forward integration
- Industry not critical customer

**Assessment Questions**:
- How concentrated is the supplier base?
- Are inputs commoditized or specialized?
- What are switching costs?
- Can suppliers bypass you to reach customers?

**Rating Scale**:
| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Commodity inputs, many suppliers |
| 3 | Some supplier leverage |
| 5 | Supplier dominance, high dependency |

### 3. Buyer Power

**Definition**: Ability of customers to drive down prices.

**High Power When**:
- Few buyers purchase large volumes
- Products are undifferentiated
- Low switching costs
- Price sensitivity is high
- Threat of backward integration

**Assessment Questions**:
- How concentrated are buyers?
- What portion of costs does your product represent?
- How price-sensitive are buyers?
- Can buyers produce this themselves?

**Rating Scale**:
| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Fragmented buyers, high switching costs |
| 3 | Moderate buyer leverage |
| 5 | Concentrated buyers, commodity product |

### 4. Threat of Substitution

**Definition**: Likelihood customers switch to alternative solutions.

**High Threat When**:
- Substitutes offer better price-performance
- Low switching costs
- Buyer propensity to substitute
- Substitute quality improving

**Assessment Questions**:
- What alternatives solve the same problem?
- How does price-performance compare?
- What are switching costs to substitutes?
- Are substitutes improving?

**Rating Scale**:
| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | No viable substitutes |
| 3 | Some alternatives exist |
| 5 | Many strong substitutes |

### 5. Threat of New Entry

**Definition**: Ease with which new competitors can enter.

**High Threat When**:
- Low capital requirements
- Weak brand loyalty
- Easy access to distribution
- No proprietary technology
- Minimal regulatory barriers

**Assessment Questions**:
- What capital is required to compete?
- How strong are incumbent brands?
- Can new entrants access distribution?
- What regulatory barriers exist?

**Rating Scale**:
| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | High barriers, protected market |
| 3 | Moderate barriers |
| 5 | Low barriers, easy entry |
