## Interview Structure

### Opening (5-10 minutes)

**Goals**:
- Build rapport
- Set expectations
- Get permission to record

**Script Template**:
> "Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I'm [name] from [company], and we're researching how [target users] handle [problem area]. I want to understand your experience - there are no right or wrong answers. I'm here to learn from you.
>
> Do you mind if I record this conversation? It's just for my notes and won't be shared outside our team."

**Tips**:
- Small talk first (weather, how busy they are)
- Explain confidentiality
- Set time expectations

### Context Setting (5-10 minutes)

- "What's the most frustrating part of that process?"
- "Tell me about a recent time when [problem] happened."
- "How do you deal with [challenge] today?"
- "What would make this easier?"

**Probing Techniques**:
- "Tell me more about that."

- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What happened next?"

### Solution Exploration (10-15 minutes)

- "Would this fit into your workflow?"

### Closing (5 minutes)

**Goals**:
- Wrap up gracefully
- Get referrals
- Leave door open

**Questions**:
- "Is there anything else you think I should know?"
- "Is there anyone else you think I should talk to?"
- "Would it be okay if I followed up with additional questions?"

**Script**:
> "This has been incredibly helpful. Thank you for your time and insights. I may have a few follow-up questions - would it be okay to reach out via email? And if you think of anyone else who might have interesting perspectives on this, I'd appreciate an introduction."

## Question Design

### Open vs. Closed Questions

| Type | Example | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| Open | "How do you handle X?" | Exploring, learning |
| Closed | "Do you use Y?" | Confirming, quantifying |

**Default to open questions** in discovery interviews.

### Good Question Patterns

**Experience-based**:
- "Tell me about the last time you..."
- "Walk me through how you..."
- "Describe a situation when..."

**Problem-focused**:
- "What's the hardest part about...?"
- "What frustrates you most about...?"
- "Where do you get stuck...?"

**Behavior-focused**:
- "How do you currently...?"
- "What do you do when...?"
- "Show me how you would..."

### Questions to Avoid

**Leading questions**:
- ❌ "Don't you think X is a problem?"
- ✓ "How do you feel about X?"

**Hypothetical future behavior**:
- ❌ "Would you use this?"
- ✓ "Tell me about the last time you tried something like this."

**Multiple questions**:
- ❌ "Do you like A and what about B?"
- ✓ Ask one at a time

## Active Listening Techniques

### Silence
- Pause after answers
- Let them fill the silence
- Count to 5 before moving on

### Mirroring
- Repeat last few words as a question
- "...and that was frustrating?"

### Summarizing
- "So what I'm hearing is..."
- Confirm understanding, prompt elaboration

### Following the Thread
- Notice emotional cues
- Dig into stories
- "You mentioned X - tell me more."
