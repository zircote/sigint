- Likelihood: Based on enforcement patterns
- Impact: Investigations, penalties

**Reputational Risk**

- Likelihood: Based on sensitivity of issues
- Impact: Customer trust, brand damage

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Trend | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-------|------------|
| [Risk] | H/M/L | H/M/L | INC/DEC/CONST | [Action] |

## Regulatory Trend Analysis

### Trend Indicators

**INC (Increasing regulation)**
