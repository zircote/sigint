Convert research findings into sprint-sized GitHub issues.

**Arguments:**
- `--repo` - Target repository (default: current directory's repo or configured default)
- `--dry-run` - Preview issues without creating them
- `--labels` - Additional labels to apply (comma-separated)

**Issue Categories:**

1. **Feature Requests** (label: `enhancement`)
   - New capabilities suggested by market analysis
   - Competitive feature gaps to address
   - Customer-requested functionality

2. **Enhancements** (label: `enhancement`)
   - Improvements to existing features
   - Performance optimizations
   - UX improvements based on research

3. **Research Tasks** (label: `research`)
   - Further investigation needed
   - Data validation required
   - Technical feasibility studies

4. **Action Items** (label: `action-item`)
   - Immediate to-dos
   - Process changes
   - Documentation updates

**Issue Generation Process:**

1. **Load research findings:**
   Read state.json and any generated reports.
   Identify actionable items from:
   - Recommendations section
   - Competitive gaps
   - Risk mitigations
   - Opportunity captures

2. **Atomize into sprint-sized issues:**
   Break large initiatives into:
   - Discrete, completable tasks
   - Each achievable in ~1 sprint
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Logical dependencies noted

3. **Generate issue content:**
   For each issue:
   ```markdown
   ## Summary
   [Brief description from research]

   ## Context
   [Link to relevant research finding]
   [Market/competitive context]

   ## Acceptance Criteria
   - [ ] Specific criterion 1
   - [ ] Specific criterion 2

   ## Research Source
   Generated by sigint from: [topic] research
   Finding ID: [reference]
   ```

4. **Determine repository:**
   Use `--repo` argument, or check:
   - `.claude/sigint.local.md` for default_repo
   - Current directory git remote

5. **Create issues (or preview):**
   If `--dry-run`: Display issues without creating.
   Otherwise: Use GitHub MCP tools or `gh` CLI to create issues.
   Apply appropriate labels and link related issues.

6. **Save issue manifest:**
   Write `./reports/[topic]/YYYY-MM-DD-issues.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "created": "ISO_DATE",
     "repository": "owner/repo",
     "issues": [
       {"number": 123, "title": "...", "type": "feature"},
       ...
     ]
   }
   ```

7. **Capture to Subcog:**
   Store issue creation for future reference.
   Link issues to research findings.

**Output:**
- List of created issues with numbers and URLs
- Issue manifest file location
- Summary by category

**Example usage:**
```
/sigint:issues
/sigint:issues --dry-run
/sigint:issues --repo myorg/myrepo --labels "market-research,q1-2024"
```
